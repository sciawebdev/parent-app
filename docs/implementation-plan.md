## 🎯 **CURRENT PHASE: Admin Console & Production Readiness**

### Phase 1: Admin Console Development (In Progress)

#### **Separate Admin Console Architecture**
Creating a dedicated web-based admin console separate from the parent mobile app:

**Admin Console Features:**
1. **User Management** - Bulk parent login generation with credentials
2. **CSV Import System** - Enhanced interface for students, attendance, marks
3. **Calendar & Events** - Create school events with parent RSVP functionality
4. **Notification Center** - Send targeted notifications to parents
5. **Analytics Dashboard** - School-wide statistics and reports
6. **Settings Management** - System configuration and preferences

**Target Users:**
- ✅ School Administrators (full access)
- ✅ Office Staff (limited access)
- ✅ Teachers (view-only access to their classes)
- ❌ Parents (use mobile app only)

**Admin Console Benefits:**
- 🖥️ **Web-based** - No app installation required
- 🔧 **Easy to Use** - Intuitive interface for non-technical staff
- 📊 **Comprehensive** - Complete school management in one place
- 🔒 **Secure** - Role-based access control

### Phase 2: Android App Testing & Optimization

#### **USB Debugging & Device Testing**
Test the existing mobile app features on connected Android device:

**Testing Scope:**
- 📱 **Core Navigation** - Bottom navigation and screen transitions
- 🔔 **Notifications** - Real-time notification display and filtering
- 📊 **Dashboard** - Attendance summary and student data display
- 📅 **Attendance History** - Date filtering and statistics
- 📈 **Marks View** - Grade display and performance analytics
- 🔄 **Data Sync** - Real-time updates from Supabase

**Testing Environment:**
- ✅ Android device connected via USB debugging
- ✅ Chrome DevTools for debugging
- ✅ React DevTools for component inspection
- ✅ Network tab for API monitoring

### Phase 3: Production Readiness Assessment

#### **Performance & Security Audit**
- Code optimization and bundle size analysis
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Database query optimization
- Error handling and logging improvements

#### **User Experience & Accessibility**
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG)
- User journey optimization
- Performance metrics (Lighthouse scores)

## E. Data Model (Supabase Postgres)

```sql
-- ✅ IMPLEMENTED
students   (id, name, class, section, fedena_id, created_at, updated_at)
parents    (id, email, phone, created_at, updated_at)  
teachers   (id, email, phone, fedena_id, created_at, updated_at)
attendance (id, student_id, date, status, imported_at)
marks      (id, student_id, subject, score, max_score, term, imported_at)
messages   (id, from_user, to_user, body, sent_at, read_at)
student_parents (student_id, parent_id) -- Link table

-- ⏳ PENDING
events     (id, title, description, date, type, created_by)
user_roles (user_id, role, permissions[])
```
*Row Level Security* rules ensure parents see only their child data; teachers only their classes.
